# SWIM-team-junior-project
Oregon Institute of Technology Junior Project Sequence, Surface Water Information Management System (SWIM)


# Executive Summary
The following is a proposal for Junior Project pertaining to a surface water
information and monitoring system. This will be designed for the purpose of regulating
water usage and the associated cost of equipment maintenance. Surface water sites
targeted by this project are typically agricultural and residential. It will be designed to
minimize the labor required to monitor water usage.
This project requires the use of a microprocessor to receive data from several
sensors to maintain an accurate measurement of water being used and how much
water is available for use. This will allow water pumps to be controlled remotely and can
detect issues with water flow.
It will be designed to facilitate not only measurements but also a diagnostic of its
sensors. If a sensor detects an issue it will alert the user of the error and specify which
component has gone bad. The display will be clear at a glance and store data for water
usage over any specified amount of time by the consumer.
This product will allow people to do what they need to do without wasting the
time that would otherwise be used to measure water and determine usage statistics.
This provides better uses of time and resources that could be used to improve
productivity.
